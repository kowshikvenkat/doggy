            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>An ancient Japanese breed, the Shiba Inu is a little but well-muscled <br>
          dog once employed as a hunter. Today, the spirited, good-natured Shiba <br>
          is the most popular companion dog in Japan.Shibas are growing in <br>
         popularity in the West and are already the most popular breed in <br>
          their homeland.

        <h1>ORIGIN</h1>
        <p>
        The Shiba Inu has been identified as a basal breed that predates the emergence of the modern <br>
       breeds in the 19th century. Originally, the Shiba Inu was bred to hunt and flush small game, <br>
        such as birds and rabbit. Shiba lived in the mountainous areas of the Chūbu region.The Shiba <br>
       was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1992 and added to the AKC Non-Sporting Group <br>
        in 1993.

        <h1>NATURE OF LIVINGHOOD</h1>
        <p>
        Shibas tend to exhibit an independent nature.The dog has a spirited boldness and is <br>
        fiercely proud with a good nature and a feeling of artlessness. The Shiba is able to <br>
         move quickly with nimble, elastic steps.They can often be seen licking their paws <br>
          and legs, much as cats do.

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Shiba Inu </b> is about 12 to 15 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT SHIBA INU GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
   <ul>
       
    <li>Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA)-As it progresses, the vision loss worsens and the canine begins to struggle even in plain daylight.</li>
    <li>Cataracts usually occur in the later stages of a Shiba Inu’s life, and vary in severity.</li>
<li>
    Patellar Luxation -
    This condition occurs when the ligament in the knee is weak and dislocates
</li>
<li>Seizures-They can take shape as the Shiba Inu running around ceaselessly, hiding in corners in complete confusion, barking at
nothing, and freezing up.</li>
</ul>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>


The Shiba Inu has a thick coat, and, because of this, sheds a lot of hair. You’ll need to brush it several times a week,
even daily, during the shedding season. If that’s not possible, then one or two brushing sessions a week should suffice.

It’s advisable to brush their teeth two or three times a week to prevent bad breath and gum disease. The nails of the
Shiba Inu should be trimmed once or twice a month, to prevent foot injuries.
  
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
Processed foods do a lot more harm than good in the long term. So, choosing a healthier diet means improving the health
of your dog’s digestive system.But this doesn’t mean that you can’t feed dry food to the Shiba Inu. You just have to take into account a series of
characteristics that dry food should (or shouldn’t) have:
<ul>

<li>It must have meat as its main source of protein.</li>
<li>Don’t buy foods with wheat, corn or soy as main ingredients (many dogs are allergic to wheat and corn). For carbohydrate
sources, potatoes and rice are the easiest to digest.</li>
<li>Stay away from foods with too many by-products in the list of ingredients (flour, additives, high amounts of vitamin D,
etc).</li>
<li>Avoid foods with artificial colors and preservatives.</li>



</ul>
    </p>
