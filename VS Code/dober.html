            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>Sleek and powerful, possessing both a magnificent physique and keen <br>
           intelligence, the Doberman Pinscher is one of dogkind's noblemen. <br>

        <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
        Louis Dobermann, a German tax collector, created the Doberman Pinscher breed in 1870. <br>
       It is believed the breed originated from the mix of cattle and shepherd dogs. In 1895, <br>
        the dog was mixed with Manchester terrier and at the beginning of the 20th century, <br>
     Greyhound bloodline was introduced. The Doberman at that time was not as finely chiseled <br>
        and sleek as it is today.

       people, if socialized and trained properly. They are loyal to their owners and are good with <br>
        children if raised with them; however, some Dobermans bond only to one person.Doberman <br>
         pinschers are powerful, energetic dogs that need lots of exercise.

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>
<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>

        ventricles) is weakened by progressive stretching</li> <br>
        <li>Poor oxygenation prevents other organs from performing optimally (generating different insufficiency charts), and can
        also lead to irreversible injuries when not treated quickly.</li>
        <li>Wobbler syndrome is a silent neurologic disease.</li>
        <li>It is characterized by an excessive dilation of the stomach, causing the organ to twist on its own axis.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>

        to do. This dog is sensitive and hence, it is advised that you do not scold it even if it makes a mistake.

        And that are low in unnecessary additives like corn, soy, and wheat.
        
        Although Doberman puppies start out small, they eventually grow into large, muscular dogs who were bred for work.

        Natural chicken,
        Food with certain amount of fats in it,
