        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>The Labrador was bred to be both a <br>
        friendly companion and a useful working dog <br>
        breed.The Labrador is one of the most <br>
        popular dog breeds , particularly in the Western <br>
        world.Labradors are frequently trained to <br>
        aid those with blindness or autism, act as a <br>
        therapy dog, or perform screening and detection <br>
        work for law enforcement and other official <br> agencies.</p>
</div>
<div id="origin">
    <h1>ORIGIN </h1>
    <p>
        Labradors, despite their name, actually originated in Newfoundland. The breed <br>
        was developed from the St.John’s water dog, which is a combination of Newfoundlands and <br>
        small water dogs. Meanwhile, the Newfoundland came from Labrador, so the names of the <br>
        two dogs are reversed geographically. <br> <br>


        In the early 19th century, the Duke of Malmesbury developed an interest in the breed and <br>
        brought them to England to serve as gun dogs in retrieving waterfowl during hunts. The <br>
        breed died out in Newfoundland due to a dog tax meant to protect sheep and English <br>
        rabies quarantine laws. But the English were able to preserve and develop the breed <br>
        standards still known and loved today. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel <br>
        Club in 1917.

        as a very even-tempered breed and an excellent family dog.This includes a good <br>
        reputation with children of all ages and other animals.Labradors as a breed are curious <br>
        and exploratory and love company, following both people and interesting scents for <br>
        food, attention, and novelty value.

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Doing things like puppy proofing your house before your dog arrives,
            will make it easier during those first days
            together.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p style="text-align: centre;">The Labrador breed has a lifespan of 10 to 12 years.</p>
    <h2> DISEASES LABRADOR GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>Some of the general health conditions that afflict Labradors are patellar luxation,
        canine hip dysplasia (CHD), andosteochondritis dissecans (OCD), which is canine elbow
        and shoulder dysplasia. This breed also occasionally suffers fromdistichiasis,
        exercise-induced collapse, diabetes, muscular dystrophy, tricuspid valve dysplasia,
        and entropion. Minorhealth concerns include retinal dysplasia, central progressive
        retinal atrophy (CPRA), hypothyroidism, hot spots, andcataract.</p>
    <h2>HYGIENE</h2>
    <p>
        Knee, hip, eye, and elbow tests should be included in the usual medical check-ups.
        Obesity is a common problem for many dogs, including Labs.

        Thankfully, it is fairly easy to prevent; simply monitor your dog’s eating habits,
        and make sure he doesn’t eat too much
        or too fast at meal times or snack in between.
        Labradors are known for their large, floppy ears, which give them a comical look that is rather endearing.

        However, their large ears also provide a suitable breeding ground for bacteria, making Labs more susceptible to
        ear
        infections.

        You can keep ear infections at bay by ensuring your dog’s ears stay clean and dry (take
        care to dry them after baths or swimming), checking often for any signs of infection,
        and removing any excessive hair in the ears (a groomer can handle
        this for you).
    </p>
    <h2>FEEDING TIPS</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>

        <li> 40 – 45 pound Lab, feed: 205 – 230 grams per day</li>
        <li> 50 – 55 pound Lab, feed: 240 – 265 grams per day</li>
        <li> 60 – 65 pound Lab, feed: 270 – 300 grams per day</li>
