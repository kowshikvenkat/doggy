            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>The tiny Pomeranian, long a favorite of royals and commoners alike, <br>
           has been called the ideal companion. The glorious coat, smiling, foxy <br>
          face, and vivacious personality have helped make the Pom one of the <br>
           world's most popular toy breeds.</p>
    </div>
    
    
    <div id="origin">
        <h1>HISTORY</h1>
        <p>
        
        The Pomeranian is a miniaturized relation of the powerful spitz-type sled dogs of the <br>
        Arctic. The breed is named for Pomerania, the area of northeastern Europe that is now <br>
         part of Poland and western Germany. It was there, hundreds of years ago, that the <br>
          Pom’s ancestors were bred down from their much bigger, burlier cousins.

        <h1>NATURE AND BEHAVIOUR</h1>
        <p>If a person is very loud and full of energy, in time a Pom will usually mimic that <br>
           energy and be active and vocal. If a person tends to be quiet and shy, they will <br>
          usually find that their Pomeranian adapts to a more quiet and relaxed state. Poms <br>
           adopted through shelters may have some anxiety, shyness and/or need extra time to become <br>
            accustomed to a new   household.

        <h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>The breed standard calls out for just '3 - 7 pounds with the ideal weight for show specimens <br>
          being 4 to 6 pounds.’ (1.36 – 3.18 kg and 1.8 to 2.72 kg).Pomeranians have small triangle ears <br>
           that naturally stand erect [C].A Pomeranian's tail is heavily plumed with lots of fur and is set <br>
        high on the rump.Pomeranians can be found in a wide variety of colors, with solids, partis, tri-colors, <br>
         and several patterns.

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="steps">
        <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
                Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
                care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>
    
            <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
                few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
            <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
                any access to small objects or cables will all
                help.</li>
            <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
                nutrition, exercise, and interaction
                as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
            <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
                tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
            <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
                It’s also important to select an area where
                your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
                A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
        </ul>
    
        </p>
        <h2>
            LIFESPAN
        </h2>
        <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Pomeranian </b>is about 12 to 16 years</p>
        <h2>DISEASES THAT POMERANIAN GETS AFFECTED</h2>
        <p>
        Hypoglycemia occurs when blood sugar levels suddenly drop. This can be very dangerous for dogs,
         even sometimes fatal.  The condition most commonly happens to puppies under the age of
         3 months or small breeds of dogs. The signs can appear quickly and include weakness,
          loss of appetite, lack of coordination.<br> <br>       
        A coat loss condition, sometimes referred to as Severe Hair Loss Syndrome (SHLS), can affect Pomeranians. <br><br>
        Canine cataracts are one of the most common problems affecting the eyes of dogs.
        </p>
        <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Poms should be given a bath every 3 weeks; if body oils are washed away much more often than this, the body can have a
            hard time keeping up with replenishing those oils which can lead to chronic dry skin issues. So, it’s vital to make each
            bath count.</li>
            <li>Brush the coat often-Freeing the coat of dead hairs allows the coat to perk back up.
            Brushing helps distribute body oils which adds shine to hairs.</li>
            <li>The hair in the ears needs to be clipped or plucked on a regular basis to avoid infection.</li>
            <li>You can use a general grooming wipe for face-cleaning, but if your Pom tends to need lots of cleaning around the eyes approach a vet</li>
            <li>Body temperature-Yorkies often need some type of sweater in the colder months, even for short trips</li>
    
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
        <p>
        They have high energy levels and require food at regular intervals. A growing Pomeranian pup should be fed three to four
        times in a day. When the dog has become adult, he should be fed the same amount of food two times a day.
        Add the following items if you are providing home made food
        <ul>
<li>Lean meats including fish, white breast chicken and lean Hamburg</li>
<li>Sweet or regular potatoes, spinach, baby carrots, zucchini and broccoli (No corn please)</li>
<li>White or Brown rice</li>

        </ul>
