            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>The dignified Dalmatian, dogdom's citizen of the world, is famed <br>
           for his spotted coat and unique job description.The Dalmatian's <br>
          delightful, eye-catching spots of black or liver adorn one of the <br>
           most distinctive coats in the animal kingdom.

        <h1>ORIGIN</h1>
        <p>
        The Dalmatian's true origins are up for debate, but evidence of similar types of dogs goes <br>
       back to ancient times. It is likely that the breed did not actually originate in Dalmatia <br>
        (present-day Croatia), but it is certain that Dalmatians were once used as sentinels in <br>
       the area.  The Dalmatian is known for its affinity with horses, which made it the original <br>
        and prized carriage dog or coach dog in England.

        <h1>TEMPERAMENT</h1>
        <p>
        The temperament of a dalmatian tends to be loving, energetic, and athletic. Because of their <br>
       high energy levels, they need an owner that is able to take them out on a regular basis and <br>
       that can give them an active lifestyle. Another important thing to note is that Dalmatians <br>
       love to be around their owners. Whether you’re cooking in the kitchen or lounging on the <br>
        couch, you can expect your Dalmatian to be right by your side wherever you go.

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Dalmation</b> is about 10 to 15 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT DALMATION GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>

        <li>Deafness: About 10 to 12 percent of Dalmatians are born deaf and 22 to 24 percent have hearing only in one ear.</li>
        <li>Hip Dysplasia: This is an inherited condition that can produce lameness and arthritis.</li>
        <li>
            Urinary Issues (infections, stones):They need plenty of water and food that is not high in purines.
        </li>
        <li>Skin Allergies: Dalmatians may have food-based allergies, contact allergies, or inhalant allergies.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>
        This breed requires little more than basic grooming.Be sure to clean the Dalmatian's ears regularly to prevent ear infections. In addition, keep the nails neatly trimmed so
        your Dalmatian can walk around comfortably and safely.Dalmatians need tons of exercise and plenty of activities.
    Otherwise, they are prone to weight gain, anxiety, and even behavior problems.
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
    Feed your Dalmatian a low-purine diet: Purines are a substance that, when not metabolized properly, contribute to the
    formation of urate crystals in your Dalmatian’s urinary tract. <br><br>
    Establish a feeding schedule for your Dalmatian. If you have a Dalmatian puppy, feed him 3 times a day. <br><br>
    Give your Dalmatian unlimited access to fresh water.Since Dalmatians are prone to developing urinary stones, they need to drink water constantly to flush out their urinary
    system. <br><br>
