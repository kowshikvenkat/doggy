        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>Loyalty, affection, intelligence, work ethic, and good <br>
    looks: Boxers are the whole doggy package. Bright and alert, <br>
    sometimes silly, but always courageous, the Boxer has <br>
    been among America's most popular dog breeds for a very <br>
    long time.

    <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>
        The ancestors of boxers can be traced back to a variety of dog breeds throughout Europe in <br>
       the 16th century, but the breed was developed and perfected over the last several hundred <br>
        years in Germany. Boxers are related to nearly all bulldog-type breeds.The breed was <br>
         recognized by the AKC in 1904. The American Boxer Club (ABC) was formed in 1935.

    <h1>TEMPERAMENT</h1>

    temperament that makes it an ideal companion. Boxers often get along very well with children <br>
   and possess an instinct to protect the family, making  them wonderful family dogs, despite <br>
    their history as fighting dogs.

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Boxer</b> is about 10 to 12 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT BOXER GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
       <ul>


<li>Cancer: Boxers are prone to several types of cancer, including mast cell tumors, lymphoma, and skin cancer.</li>
<li>Deafness: Loss of hearing is associated with white coloring and may be seen in all-white or mostly-white boxers.</li>
<li>Aortic stenosis: This narrowing of the aorta causes the heart to work harder. It is a genetic condition and dogs with it
should not be bred. It can cause fainting and sudden death.</li>
       </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>
        Because boxers have very short hair coats, they have relatively simple grooming needs. Most boxers need occasional
        bathing and brushing. Although an active boxer may wear down its nails, keep an eye on them. Regular nail trims are
        important in order to keep their feet healthy and comfortable.It is best to keep boxers indoors during extreme weather, hot or cold. Exercise your boxer during the coolest part of
        the day during hot weather.Take your boxer for a 30-minute walk at least twice a day and play fetch or other active games.
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
Though many Boxers may prefer wet canned food, dry kibble is better to maintain healthy teeth and gum and a strong jaw.
You'll still have to provide some level of at-home dental care, but the crunch of a hard kibble will work to some extent
to remove plaque. Additionally, dry food seems to keep the stools firmer and healthier.

If your Boxer is a finicky eater and balks at dry food, try mixing in just a bit of canned (stick with the same brand)
or add just a bit of water or low-sodium chicken or beef broth. <br><br>
Avoid following food items:-
<ul>

<li>
    No grains at all. Until conclusive studies are complete, play it safe and offer a kibble with some level of healthy
    grains unless the veterinarian recommends otherwise
</li>

<li>Artificial coloring. Common dyes like Yellow #5 and #6 and Blue #2 are linked to behavioral and health issues.</li>
<li>Artificial flavor enhancers. MSG is one of the worst, it is linked to anxiety, rapid heartbeat, and breathing issues.</li>
</ul>

    </p>
