        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds. <br>
        The breed’s friendly, tolerant attitude makes them great <br>
        family pets. These dogs are fairly easy to train and get <br>
        along in just about any home or family. They’re great with <br>
        kids and very protective of their humans.</p>
</div>
<div id="origin">
    <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>
        Golden retrievers originated from the Scottish Highlands, where they were used <br>
        primarily as hunting dogs. The Scottish estate owners needed a dog that could <br>
        retrieve birds either in water or on land because their hunting grounds had many <br>
        ponds and marshes.During the early 20th century, golden retrievers were introduced <br>
        to North America as both a hunting dog and a companion.The golden retriever was <br>
        officially recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1925

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>
<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Getting your home ready to share with a dog isn’t quite as intense as getting
            ready for a baby.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Be patient and practice positive reinforcement to teach your dog the house
            rules and how you expect him to behave.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>
