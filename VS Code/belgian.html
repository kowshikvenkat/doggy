    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Belgian Sheepdog</b> is about 12 to 14 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT BELGIAN SHEEPDOG GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    The Belgian Sheepdog is a study, robust breed and tend to be healthy dogs. Some conditions that
     may affect this breed include eye issues like progressive retinal atrophy and cataracts,
      epilepsy, elbow and hip dysplasia, and certain forms of cancer. Owners of these dogs
       should note that Belgian Sheepdogs are particularly sensitive to anesthesia should the
 need for surgery ever arise. Their ears should be checked regularly for signs of infection,
  and teeth should be brushed  regularly.
    </p>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>
    When it comes to coat maintenance, the Belgian Sheepdog’s double-layer coat is easier to 
    maintain than you might think.Owners of Belgian Sheepdogs should expect to participate in daily exercise sessions with their dogs, whether it’s going
    for a long walk or run, playing fetch, or training for canine sports such as flyball or competitions in agility,
    tracking, or herding.However, any training should be kept positive and fun, as this is a particularly sensitive
     breed that can also have a tendency to be strong-willed.
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
    As with most dogs, the Belgian Sheepdog Groenendael does well on any reputable dog food that contains a high nutritional
    value. Keep the dog food age-appropriate by checking the bag for what age range it was intended for. Any dog can be
    susceptible to obesity, so make sure to feed the right amount of dog food to your dog in relation to what they weigh and
    what their exercise levels are. As always, provide your dog with fresh water at all times.
