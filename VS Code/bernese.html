   named. The Berner was a general-purpose farm dog employed as a watchdog, property guard, and <br>

     dog of the midland regions of Switzerland, mostly around the city of Berne.

    <h1>TEMPERAMENT</h1>
    <p>
    Bernese mountain dogs are beloved for their sweet, calm, easygoing nature and their devotion <br>
    to their families, including small children. Big and strong Berners, which historically helped <br>
    with farming duties in Switzerland, are able to pull carts and act as guard dogs. When they're <br>
    not working or playing, these smart, loyal dogs are happiest at their owner's side, wherever <br>
     that may be.
