        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>He easygoing Great Dane, the mighty 'Apollo of Dogs,' is a total joy <br>
       to live with'but owning a dog of such imposing size, weight, and <br>
       strength is a commitment not to be entered into lightly. This breed <br>
        is indeed great, but not a Dane.
</p>
</div>


<div id="origin">
    <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>
    Great Danes originated in Germany although some believe the breed has ancient origins. <br>
   They most likely emerged from the English Mastiff and Irish wolfhound. Despite "Dane" in <br>
    its name, the breed was developed in Germany as a boar hunter.Over time, the breed was <br>
     no longer considered a hunting dog but became more known as a watchdog and companion.

    <h1>TEMPERAMENT</h1>
    <p>
        Great Danes are, in fact, loyal and kind with happy personalities and they desire to always be <br>
       near their people.Great Danes can sometimes come off as shy, aloof or reserved, but they aren’t <br>
        naturally aggressive dogs. Socializing your Great Dane puppy at an early age will help them <br>
         become more comfortable around new people and other dogs. They have a deep, powerful bark <br>
          that can be intimidating to visitors
    </p>

<div id="appearance">
    <h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
    <p>The Great Dane’s most obvious physical trait is, of course, their massive size—Danes are the <br>
      American Kennel Club’s tallest dog and among the largest overall. Their long, floppy ears are <br>
      just begging for a rub, and those droopy jowls definitely need a nuzzle. But there is a <br>
      distinct elegance coupled with their robust weight and height. Great Danes possess a regal air, <br>
      and while they’re a well-muscled dog, they’re also quite dignified with a side of mischievous  <br>
        humor.

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN

    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>The most common killer for Great Danes is Gastric Torsion, also known as canine bloat.

        <li>Hip dysplasia is a chronic condition in which the head of the femur bone doesn’t fit into the hip socket correctly.</li>
        <li>Cardiomyopathy causes the heart to enlarge and is most likely genetic.</li>
        <li>Tricuspid valve disease is a congenital condition where the heart valve doesn’t function correctly. As a result, the
        left side of your dog’s heart may fail.        </li>
