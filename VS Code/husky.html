        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>Siberian Husky, a thickly coated, compact sled dog of medium <br>
        size and great endurance, was developed to work in packs,<br>
        pulling light loads at moderate speeds over vast frozen expanses. <br>
        Sibes are friendly, fastidious, and dignified.</p>
</div>
<div id="origin">
    <h1>HISTORY </h1>
    <p>
        The Siberian husky originated in Northeast Asia, where the Chukchi people developed the <br>
        breed specifically for use as a sled dog. Genetically, they are part of the Spitz family. <br>
        During the early 20th century, Alaskans grew interested in the breed and the Siberian <br>
        husky was brought to the United States. <br><br>
        The Siberian husky was officially recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1930. <br>
        They have continued to work diligently as sled dogs but are most commonly known as <br>
        companion dogs.

    <h1>NATURE AND LIVINGHOOD</h1>

    <p>
        The Siberian husky is a graceful, athletic dog with high endurance and an eagerness to work. This <br>
        friendly dog breed,which originated in Northeast Asia as a sled dog, has a vivacious and mischievous <br>
        personality. Though these are high-energy and sometimes intense dogs, huskies can be affectionate <br>
        and gentle when given proper care. Huskies are smart dogs that can be vocal (often in the form of <br>
        howling and/or whining). Many Huskies have a desire to explore and can be escape artists.

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>
<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Doing things like puppy proofing your house before your dog arrives,
            will make it easier during those first days
            together.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>Siberian Huskies have a lifespan of around 11 to 13 years</p>
    <h2>DISEASES SIBERIAN HUSKY GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Hip Dysplasia: A condition in which the hip socket forms abnormally.</li>
        <li>Hypothyroidism: A disease where the thyroid doesn't produce a sufficient amount of hormones.</li>
        <li>Progressive Retinal Atrophy: A group of eye diseases that can eventually lead to blindness.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>HYGIENE AND NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Supervise your pet as you would a toddler. Keep doors closed, pick up after yourself, and block off rooms as
            necessary.
            This will keep her out of trouble and away from objects she shouldn’t put in her mouth.</li>
        <li>Clean her ears weekly, even as a puppy.</li>
        <li>Keep your dog’s diet consistent and don’t give her people food.</li>
        <li>Feed a high-quality diet appropriate for her age.</li>
        <li>Exercise your dog regularly, but don’t overdo it at first.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>FEEDING TIPS</h2>
    <p>
        There are three main types of diets that Siberian huskies are fed: raw food, commercial dog food including dry
        and wet
        varieties, or a combination of the two. Although feeding your husky commercial dry or wet food is less
        expensive, lasts
        longer and is easier to store, many husky parents have switched their dog’s diet to include more nutritional and
        healthier raw foods like chicken, beef, lamb, fish, fruits (no grapes, prunes or raisins) and vegetables. If you
        choose
        to feed your husky both a processed and raw diet, do not feed him both at the same meal, as they digest
        differently.
        <b> Avoid following items in your huskies diet-Avacado ,Alcohol, Sweets,Sugar,Chocolate,Onion and garlic.</b>
