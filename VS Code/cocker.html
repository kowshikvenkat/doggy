            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>The Cocker Spaniel is primarily a beloved companion dog breed, <br>
          though they remain a capable bird dog at heart. Beautiful to <br>
          look at–and labor-intensive to groom–the Cocker’s amenable, cheerful <br>
         disposition also makes them a treat to have in the family.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="origin">
        <h1>ORIGIN</h1>
        <p>
            The English cocker spaniel descends from a larger group of hunting dogs bred in Britain <br>
             and beyond to be reliable and loyal field companions. Spaniels, whose early origins may <br>
         date back as far as the 16th century, were particularly prized for their ability to assist <br>
          with hunting game birds and waterfowl.

        <h1>CHARACTERISTICS</h1>
        <p>A Cocker Spaniel’s temperament is lively, adaptable and friendly, and they can live <br>
         very happily in all types of  households.Kind and gentle, they make excellent dogs for <br>
         first-time owners. Originally bred as gundogs, Cocker Spaniels’ natural instincts to <br>
          ‘work’ mean they’re intelligent, loyal and willing to please.

        <h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>Males are about 15 inches tall and weigh about 28 pounds (13 kilograms); females <br>
          are about 14 inches tall and weigh about 25 pounds (11 kilograms). The cocker spaniel <br>
           has a round, graceful head and a broad, square muzzle. The ears are long and <br>
            feathered, and the back slopes toward the tail, giving the dog a regal appearance. <br>
         Perhaps most notable, however, is the cocker spaniel's long, silky coat with <br>
          feathering not just on the ears but also on the legs, chest, and underside. The <br>
           tail is usually docked.
        
        Cocker spaniels can have a variety of colors.

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="steps">
        <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting your home ready to share with a dog isn’t quite as intense as getting
                ready for a baby.</li>
    
            <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
                few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
            <li>Be patient and practice positive reinforcement to teach your dog the house
                rules and how you expect him to behave.</li>
            <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
                nutrition, exercise, and interaction
                as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
            <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
                tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
            <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
                It’s also important to select an area where
                your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
                A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
        </ul>
    
        </p>
        <h2>
            LIFESPAN
        </h2>
        <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Cocker Spaniel </b>is about 12 to 15 years</p>
        <h2>DISEASES THAT COCKER SPANIEL GETS AFFECTED</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Eye diseases-Cherry eye and progressive retinal atrophy are more common in Cocker Spaniels</li>
            <li>Ear infection-Cocker Spaniel’s ears are particularly vulnerable to infection</li>
            <li>Overeating</li>
            <li>Seperation anxiety-when they’re left to their own devices for too long this breed can become destructive</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
        <p>
        English Cocker Spaniels need physical activity in order to stay healthy, recharge their brains, and maintain good
        health. Exercise also really helps english cocker spaniels avoid boredom, which often has the potential to lead to to
        difficult behavior. Getting out of the house will quench most of your english cocker spaniel’s desires to chase,
        retrieve, chew, dig and herd. Exercise needs will depend on your english cocker spaniel’s level of health and his or her
        age—but 10 minutes outside and a couple of walks around the block every day probably won’t suffice.
        </p>
        <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
        <p>
            High-quality dry dogfood provides a balanced diet for adult english cocker spaniels and can mix with water, broth, or
            canned food. Your english cocker spaniel may be fond of cooked eggs, cottage cheese, and fruits and vegetables, but
            these dishes should be less than 10 pct of his daily food intake. English Cocker Spaniel pups must be fed a
            high-quality, name brand puppy food. Try to limit “table food”, though, since it can cause vitamin and mineral
            deficiencies, bone and teeth problems, and might result in some extremely finicky food choices as well as obesity.
            Clean, potable water should be made at all times, and make sure to clean water and food bowls very often.
