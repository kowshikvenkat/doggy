            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>The famously long, low silhouette, ever-alert expression, <br>
           and bold, vivacious personality of the Dachshund have made <br>
          him a superstar of the canine kingdom.Dachshunds aren't built <br>
           for distance running, leaping, or strenuous swimming, but <br>
            otherwise these tireless hounds are game  for anything.

        <h1>ORIGIN</h1>
        <p>
        The dachshund originated in Germany as a hunting dog. Though its origins can be traced as far <br>
       back as the 15th century, the breed's development really began in 17th century Germany.Dachshunds <br>
        were brought to the U.S. as early as 1885, when the breed was recognized by the American Kennel <br>
       Club (AKC), but increased in popularity in the 1930s and 1940s. To prevent them from being <br>
        ostracized during World War II, they were temporarily called badger dogs in the U.S.

        <h1>NATURE OF LIVINGHOOD</h1>
        <p>
        Despite their size, dachshunds are known for their courageous nature and will take on animals <br>
        much larger than themselves. Some may be aggressive toward strangers and other dogs.As family <br>
       dogs, dachshunds are loyal companions and good watchdogs. They are good with children if treated <br>
        well. They can be slightly difficult to train.
        </p>

    <div id="appearance">
        <h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>All three varieties of dachshunds — the smooth-, wire- and long-coated — are found in two sizes called <br>
          standard and miniature.Weight of the standard size is usually between 16 and 32 pounds. There is no <br>
           height standard for the dachshund but they are usually under nine inches in height. All three types <br>
            are known for their long backs and short muscular legs.

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>

    <div id="steps">
        <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
                Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
                care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>
    
            <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
                few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
            <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
                any access to small objects or cables will all
                help.</li>
            <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
                nutrition, exercise, and interaction
                as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
            <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
                tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
            <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
                It’s also important to select an area where
                your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
                A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
        </ul>
    
        </p>
        <h2>
            LIFESPAN
        </h2>
        <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Dachshund</b> is about 12 to 16 years.</p>
        <h2>DISEASES THAT DACHSHUND GETS AFFECTED</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
    
            <li>Intervertebral Disc Disease-which causes the vertebrae to weaken and possibly protrude into the spinal
                canal.</li>
            <li>Patella Luxation (loose knees) occurs when your dog’s knee cap pops out from its groove.</li>
            <li>
                Hip Dysplasia-
                This condition is caused by a deformity of the hip joint, where the thigh bone doesn’t properly fit into the
                socket, and
                may lead to rear leg lameness.
            </li>
            <li>Progressive Retinal Atrophy (PRA), and cataracts. The most serious of these eye conditions is PRA – a
                degenerative eye
                disease which may result in blindness.</li>
        </ul></p>
        <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
        <p>
    
        <ul>
            <li>Buy your dachshund the essentials (bed, food, lead, collar etc.)</li>
            <li>Make sure he’s microchipped and vaccinated</li>
            <li>Feed him at least twice a day (3 times for pups)</li>
            <li>Let him out for a wee every few hours (every 30 mins for pups)</li>
            <li>Exercise and play with him every day (5 mins per month of age for pups)</li>
            <li>Keep him clean and groomed</li>
            <li>Give him lots of love</li>
    
    
        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
        <p>
            Dachshunds will eat dry, wet, raw or homecooked food. Each of these options is fine, as long as you buy the
            ‘Complete’
            versions.
        <h3>DRY FOOD</h3>
        It comes in kibbles or pellets. Dry food is good because it’s affordable, you can buy it in bulk, it keeps for ages
        and
        it’s beneficial for your dachshund’s teeth
        <h3>WET FOOD</h3>
        This basically means it gives your dachshund all the nutrients he needs, without having to add other foods.
        Dachshunds
        love wet food
        <h3>RAW FOOD</h3>
        It’s becoming more and more popular to feed dachshunds a raw diet. Dachshunds generally love raw food, it’s great
        for
        their health and skin, and it’s actually quite natural for them to eat that way.
