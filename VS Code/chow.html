        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>The Chow Chow, an all-purpose dog of ancient China, presents the <br>
       picture of a muscular, deep-chested aristocrat with an air of <br>
       inscrutable timelessness.Dignified, serious-minded, and aloof, <br>
        the Chow Chow is a breed of unique delights.

    <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>
        The chow chow is a native of China and among the most ancient of all dog breeds, dating back <br>
        as early as 206 B.C. DNA analysis shows chows are in the branch that includes the shar-pei, <br>
        shiba inu, and Akita and are distinct from the lineage of all other dogs.Chows were brought <br>
       to the U.S. in the late 1800s and were officially recognized by the American Kennel Club <br>
        in 1903.

    <h1>TEMPERAMENT</h1>
    <p>
        The chow chow is a stoic and independent dog breed that is known for its bear-like appearance <br>
       and blue-black tongue. Though the breed sometimes has a reputation for being aggressive, most <br>
        chows are loyal, calm dogs that make excellent companions.
    </p>
    <i class="fas fa-hand-point-down"></i>

<div id="appearance">
    <h1>APPEARANCE</h1>
    <p>The Chow Chow is a sturdily built dog, square in profile, with a broad skull and small, triangular, <br>
      erect ears with rounded tips. The breed is known for a very dense double coat that is either smooth <br>
       or rough. The fur is particularly thick in the neck area, giving it a distinctive ruff or mane <br>
        appearance.The blue-black/purple tongue gene appears to be dominant, as most mixed breed dogs <br>
       that come from a Chow Chow retain that tongue colour.

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Chow Chow</b> is about 9 to 15 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT CHOW CHOW GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>

        <li>Dental disease starts with tartar build-up on the teeth and progresses to infection of the gums and roots of the teeth.</li>
        <li>Rough Coated Chow Chows are susceptible to bacterial and viral infections.
        </li>
        <li>
           Obesity is a serious disease that may cause or worsen joint problems, metabolic and digestive disorders, back pain, and heart
            disease. </li>
        <li>All kinds of worms and bugs can invade your Chow's body, inside and out. Everything from fleas and ticks to ear mites
        can infest her skin and ears.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>
        Their coats do not require much maintenance, usually just a weekly brush out to remove dead hair. They do shed,
        but it
        is not excessive.

        They are a naturally clean dog and they often have an aversion to water, so you are unlikely to find that they
        enjoy
        playing in muddy puddles.

        If they do need a bath, the biggest concern is ensuring that, if they are particularly wrinkly, you properly dry
        in
        between the folds. They can be prone to skin infections. They may also need their mouth cleaned after eating.
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
        Commercial dry food is convenient. It’s easy to buy and backed by manufacturer’s research. It also has a long
        shelf
        life. What it won’t do is help keep teeth clean, contrary to what many people think, so don’t think feeding Max
        dry food
        means you can skip brushing. <br> <br>
        Tip: Garnish dry food with a small spoonful of canned food, a little meat, or cottage cheese to add pizzazz.
        <br><br>

        Canned food has flavor going for it. Dogs love the taste. It’s mostly water, though, so you’re paying a lot for
        the
        amount of meat you actually get out of the can. <br><br>
        A home-cooked diet has no surprises. But it can be tricky to get the correct nutritional balance. You can’t just
        throw
        together some meat and rice and assume it will meet your dog’s needs. <br><br>
        Tip: Find recipes that have been vetted by a veterinary nutritionist. <br><br>

        Raw-food diets are healthy. But expensive. It also takes a lot more time to prepare–or used to. Plenty of
        companies are
        now selling raw food, online or in pet stores , so you don’t have to do the work. But it’s still going to cost
        you.
