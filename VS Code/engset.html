        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>The English Setter is a medium-sized sporting dog of sweet <br>

          elegant but solid dogs of beauty and charm.

    <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>
    There are artworks featuring dogs closely resembling the modern-day English Setter from as far <br>
    back as the 15th century. The breed is widely regarded as being one of the oldest of the gundog <br>
   breeds.In the 1870s, the first English Setter was imported to the United States, and the AKC <br>
   recognized them in 1884. In the 1930s one English Setter gained fame in the States. There's now <br>
    a sculpture of 'Jim the Wonderdog' in a park in Missouri.

    <h1>TEMPERAMENT</h1>
    <p>
    This breed's standard temperament is best described as a "Gentleman by Nature". However, it can <br>
    also be strong-willed and mischievous, especially if coming from working/field breeding lines. <br>
     English Setters are energetic, people-oriented dogs, that are well suited to families who can <br>
      give them attention and activity, or to working with a hunter, where they have a job to do.

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>

<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> English Setter</b> is about 10 to 12 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT ENGLISH SETTER GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>


        <li>Hip and Elbow Dysplasia: This is when the joint forms abnormally, and it can cause mobility issues and pain.
        </li>
        <li>Hypothyroidism: This is when your dog suffers from an underactive thyroid, and their metabolism slows down. This can
        lead to a variety of symptoms, including weight gain, lethargy and problems with the skin and coat.</li>
        <li>Congenital Deafness: Although not common, some English Setters can be born deaf in one or both ears. Deaf dogs can live
        full and enriching lives with a few simple adjustments to make things easier and safer for them around the home and when
        out on walks.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>
    Providing they get enough exercise, the English Setter can make a wonderful addition to a household.
    As with every dog, you need to make sure your English Setter gets an appropriate amount of daily exercise.
    English Setters are moderate shedders, and they would benefit from a good weekly brush out to keep their coat in good
    condition and to prevent any tangles developing in their abundant feathering.
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
        
Recommended daily amount: 2 to 3 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals. <br><br>

<b> NOTE:</b>  How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are
individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a
highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the
better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your
dog's bowl.
