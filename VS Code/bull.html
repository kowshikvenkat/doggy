            WHAT IS IT?
        </h1>
        <p>
           Bulldog is a muscular, hefty dog with a wrinkled face and a distinctive <br>
             pushed-in nose.Bulldogs have a longstanding association with <br>
             British culture, as the BBC wrote: "to many the Bulldog is a <br>
              national icon, symbolising pluck and determination.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="origin">
        <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
        <p>
            Bulldogs were originally bred to help butchers control livestock, although bulldogs <br>
            most likely predate pit bills, with  a history that can possibly be traced back to <br>
             the 5th century in England.Over the course of 350 years, until bull-baiting was banned <br>
             in 1835, bulldogs were bred for aggression, and an 80-pound dog could easily bring <br>
         down a bull weighing close to a ton by corkscrewing its own body around its neck

            TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
        </h1>
        <p>
            Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id="steps">
        <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Getting your home ready to share with a dog isn’t quite as intense as getting
                ready for a baby.</li>

            <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
                few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
            <li>Be patient and practice positive reinforcement to teach your dog the house
                rules and how you expect him to behave.</li>
            <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
                nutrition, exercise, and interaction
                as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
            <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
                tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
            <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
                It’s also important to select an area where
                your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
                A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
        </ul>

        </p>
        <h2>
            LIFESPAN
        </h2>
        <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Bulldog </b>is about 8 to 10 years</p>
        <h2>DISEASES THAT BULLDOG GETS AFFECTED</h2>
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>Breathing problems and panting</li>
            <li>Chronic discomfort</li>
            <li>Pneumonia – Pneumonia happens when the lower respiratory tracts become irritated. This irritation usually occurs when
            your dog inhales vomit or regurgitation and can cause severe damage to the lungs and surrounding tissue.</li>
            <li>Eczema, or “canine atopic dermatitis,” is the most common skin issue found in bulldogs. It causes itchy, dried-out skin
            that can turn into a scaly rash</li>

        </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>HYGIENE AND HEALTH</h2>
        <p>
            Follow the primary steps below
        <ol>
            <li>Bath-4 weeks once</li>
            <li>Hair Brushing-7 days once</li>
            <li>Ears Cleaning- 4 weeks once</li>
            <li>Teeth Brushing-2 weeks once</li>
            
        </ol>
        You should feed it three times a day on a regular schedule for the first four months after arrival.
        Feed your English bulldog puppy a high-quality and well-balanced diet.
        </p>
        <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
        <p>
            A plastic bowl should not be used for food or water. Stainless steel bowls can be easily
             cleaned and have less bacteria as compared to a plastic bowl.Primary ingredient should be 
             quality meat such as chicken, lamb, fish, beef etc.The food should have healthy fats.
            You can feed biscuits as treats to your bulldog. Rawhide bones should be avoided.
            The dog food you are selecting for your bulldog should have good sources of carbohydrates.
