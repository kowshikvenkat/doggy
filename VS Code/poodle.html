        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>Elegant. Proud. Clever. The Poodle is an impressive dog, as the <br>
       many best-in-show winners from this dog breed can attest. But <br>
       behind the blue ribbons, impressive hairdos, and regal attitude, <br>
       you’ll find an affectionate family dog with an ancient history <br>
        and many talents.

    <h1>ORIGIN</h1>
    <p>
        The Poodle was bred to be a duck hunting dog in Germany over 400 years ago where <br>
         its thick curly coat came in handy to protect itself against the cold. Their athletic <br>
         skills and eagerness to please made them perfect retrievers.Poodles, specifically, have <br>
          historically been desired for circuses due to their high intelligence and athleticism. <br>
        The  Poodle was first bred in America in the early 20th century as a companion dog

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>


<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Make a life-long commitment to take care of your dog by providing him with adequate
            nutrition, exercise, and interaction
            as well as veterinary care and training..</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>The average lifespan for a <b> Poodle</b> is about 12 to 15 years.</p>
    <h2>DISEASES THAT POODLE GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>

        <li>Bloat occurs when gas gets trapped inside a dog’s stomach. The stomach twists as much as 180 degrees, stopping the flow
        of digestion</li>
        <li>Poodles typically have a relaxed temperament by nature, but when their adrenal glands can’t produce normal levels of
        cortisol, this extra calm behavior can be a sign of Addison’s.</li>
        <li>
        Unfortunately, poodles may also prone to developing thyroid issues at some point in their lives
        </li>
        <li>Epileptic seizures in dogs are as shocking for canines as they are for humans. Dogs will often seem confused or panicked
        about what’s happening, and the sight of your dog seizing can be terrifying to watch.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2> HEALTH CARE</h2>
    <p>
Once the dog is older and has stopped growing, anti-inflammatories and pain medication might be coupled with bed rest to
help reduce the amount of discomfort.
    <ul>
        <li>Keep your dog fit and at the proper weight relative to its size</li>
        <li>Hold off on strenuous exercise until the Poodle reaches adulthood</li>
        <li>If your dog is growing faster than average, keep exercise to a minimum and consult with your veterinarian.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>FOOD NUTRITION</h2>
    <p>
    If you are providing homemade or raw food to your poodle, make sure his diet contains Organs (kidney, liver & brain),
    lean meat, veggies, sweet potato, quinoa, barley, fruits, and eggs.Quality animal protein should be in the list of nutrients which your dog is consuming. Healthy fats, carbohydrates,
    vitamins and minerals will follow.These foods should NOT be given to your poodle:Chocolate,
