        WHAT IS IT?
    </h1>
    <p>The beagle is a breed of small scent hound, similar in appearance <br>
        to the much larger foxhound.It is a popular pet due to its size, <br>
        good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems.Beagles have <br>
        been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature <br>
        and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books.</p>
</div>
<div id="origin">
    <h1>HISTORY AND BACKGROUND</h1>
    <p>
        The beagle was developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling).Possessing a great sense <br>
        of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as a detection <br>
        dog for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs.Over time, the breed was developed in <br>
        England and, later, in North America. Beagles became more refined and widely recognized in <br>
        North America by the late 19th century, eventually becoming one of the most popular breeds. <br>
        Though still used in packs for hunting today, beagles are commonly seen as wonderful <br>
        companions and family dogs. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club (AKC) <br> in 1885

        TIME TO GROW YOUR OWN DOG!
    </h1>
    <p>
        Now you have to follow or actually you have to know few tips before buying your own puppy
    </p>
</div>
<div id="steps">
    <h1>STEPS TO FOLLOW</h1>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>Good preparation creates a smoother transition into dog ownership.
            Make sure you have a plan in mind for who is going to
            care for your pup during the day if you work full time.</li>

        <li>They won’t be able to be left for more than an hour or so at most for a
            few weeks, so planning ahead is a big deal.</li>
        <li>Doing things like puppy proofing your house before your dog arrives,
            will make it easier during those first days
            together.</li>
        <li>Adding baby gates to the doorways, buying a puppy playpen and removing
            any access to small objects or cables will all
            help.</li>
        <li>Buy a collar, leash, and tags for your new puppy.Your puppy's
            tags should include its name, your name, your phone number, and your address.</li>
        <li>Choose a spot that is out of the way, so that the puppy isn’t underfoot.
            It’s also important to select an area where
            your puppy won’t feel isolated from the rest of the family.
            A corner of the living room is a good choice.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>
    <h2>
        LIFESPAN
    </h2>
    <p>Beagles have a lifespan of around 10 to 15years</p>
    <h2>DISEASES BEAGLE GETS AFFECTED</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>They are also susceptible to kidney disease. Symptoms of kidney disease vary, but commonly include increased
            thirst and
            urination.</li>
        <li>Another relatively common problem in Beagles is epilepsy, which manifests itself as a seizure.</li>
        <li>If your pet has mange there will be patches of hair loss anywhere on its body, but particularly towards the
            head area.</li>

    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>HYGIENE AND HEALTH</h2>
    <p>
    <ul>
        <li>It also needs to spend equal time in the yard as it does in the house.</li>
        <li>Regular exercise, such as a romp at the park or in a spacious yard area, along with regular leash-led walks
            are great
            outdoor activities for the Beagle.</li>
        <li>Beagle doesn't need extensive grooming</li>
        <li>An occasional brushing to encourage turnover of hair is needed</li>


    </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>FEEDING TIPS</h2>
    <p>
        You will need to decide between commercial dog food or home cooked food. <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The pro for homemade food is that you have complete control over the ingredients, and it's very easy to
            ensure that your
            Beagle will only be taking in wholesome foods. The con is that it does take some effort to cook the meals;
            however, you
            can do this in big batches.</li> <br>
        <li>The pro for manufactured food, is that if you choose the right brand, you can feel secure that your Beagle
            is eating a
            balanced diet and is free from the harmful ingredients found in inferior brands. The con, if you opt for one
            of the
            better brands, would be the cost. You get what you pay for, so you will be spending a bit more for a quality
            food then
            if you obtained a cheaper filler & chemical filled food from your supermarket or pet store shelf.</li>
    </ul>
    Food to avoid:-
    <ul>
        <li>Fillers</li>
        <li>Artificial coloring, flavors, and chemical additives & preservatives.</li>
        <li>By products and rendered meats</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
